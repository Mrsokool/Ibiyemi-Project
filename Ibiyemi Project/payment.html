                    <h3>(1) ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</h3>
                    <p>
                      Leasing, Premium or Unlimited licenses grant non-exclusive
                      rights. And also Leasing, Premium or Unlimited licenses
                      can be sold to more than one person at the same time until
                      exclusive rights have been sold to the beat. Credit must
                      always be given to ‘O.Y Productions. By making a purchase
                      of any kind, the customer declares that he will give
                      credit to the producer where possible in a written form
                      (CD Cover/Booklet, YouTube videos, Social Network pages
                      such as Facebook, Instagram etc.). Proper credit is given
                      as follows: ‘Beat prod. by O.Y’ or ‘Music prod. by O.Y’.
                      Any displayed or downloadable MP3 files must include
                      ‘Prod. by O.Y’ within the file name.

                    <h3>(2) FREE DOWNLOAD POLICY</h3>
                    <p>
                      Free downloads of any beat produced by ‘O.Y’ do not
                      include any artistic or legislative rights to the beat.
                      Those versions are only for non profitable use, meaning
                      only for demo tracks. You are allowed to upload tracks
                      (recorded over free downloaded beats) on internet pages
                      like Instagram, Myspace, Soundclick, Facebook, Soundcloud
                      or Youtube, etc. When being uploaded or presented (for
                      demonstrational use only!), credit always has to be given
                      in a written form to ‘O.Y’ (e.g. in the song description).
                      You are NOT allowed to put the track on a mixtape or
                      album, even if it is for promotional use only. For this
                      purpose you need to purchase at least a lease. The meaning
                      of free downloads is to do a song for yourself, to do
                      first pre-recordings and to see if the song works out well
                      & maybe it's worth it, to make investments in one of the
                      license types. It is not allowed to make any kind of
                      profit with free download versions. No video-, no TV-, no
                      radio- airplay allowed! Furthermore it is not allowed to
                      make any changes to the beat or remove any of the used
                      tags. Copying or ripping any audio material (e.g. beat,
                      tag, sounds, instruments, drums, etc.) is prohibited and
                      will not be tolerated at any time! The customer is
                      breaching the terms of this agreement and most likely face
                      a law suit.
